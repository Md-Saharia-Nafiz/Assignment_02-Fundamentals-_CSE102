#  Assignment Title: C Programming Fundamentals Assignment




## Description:
This assignment is designed to demonstrate the basic concepts and core principles of programming. It includes practical examples using simple code to help understand how programming works. From declaring variables to writing functions and using loops and conditionals, this project aims to strengthen a beginner's foundation in coding. It is especially suitable for those who are just starting their journey in software development.


## 💡Key Concepts Used:
(i) Variables & Data Types – Understanding how to declare and use different types of data (integer, string, float, etc.)

(ii) Input & Output (I/O) – Taking user input and displaying results

(iii) Operators – Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators

(iv) Conditional Statements – if, if-else, elif for decision making

(v) Loops – for and while loops to repeat tasks

(vi) Functions – Creating reusable blocks of code using def

(vii) Comments – Writing single-line and multi-line comments for better code readability

(viii) Error Handling (if used) – Using try-except to handle runtime errors

(ix) Code Structure – Organized and readable programming practice

(x) Basic Algorithm Design – Implementing logic to solve problems (e.g., factorial, prime check, etc.)
## ✨Features:

✅ Beginner-friendly code structure

✅ Covers all core programming fundamentals

✅ Clean and well-commented code

✅ Interactive user input/output

✅ Logical problem-solving examples (e.g., factorial, even/odd, prime number check)

✅ Simple function-based approach

✅ Demonstrates the use of loops and conditions

✅ Organized into readable and reusable sections

✅ Ready to run without additional setup

✅ Ideal for students learning the basics of coding
